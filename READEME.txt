This is one of my projects where I just wanted to create a childhood game, named Snake.
It is one of my first childhood game where I spent hours playing it, and after I learnt to 
code, I decided to clone a childhood game SNAKE.

I hope you the viewer, yes you, I hope you like it and you should give it a try.

Every line of code is commented, so it explains a little bit about the code.
I used just Javascript, HTML and CSS  for this project. 

I will return to this project, and try to use less repetitive code, and to clean it a little bit up.

Thanks.
